#+TITLE: README

First make sure that we have a working toolchain (gcc/g++/gfortran).
In ~Ubuntu~ this can be done via ~gcc/update_toolchain_ubuntu.sh~.

For packages following =GNU= build standard, simply providing the 
URL to the tarball should suffice. 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # In <some_pkg> directory 
  source ../build_pkg.sh
  source ../gen_modules.sh

  guess_build_pkg <some_pkg_name> <some_pkg_tarball_url>
  guess_print_modfile <some_pkg_name> ${<some_pkg_name>_ver}
#+END_SRC
