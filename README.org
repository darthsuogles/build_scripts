#+TITLE: README

Build scripts for various software packages

Each script is treated as a piece of "data", rather than a program. 
They should be portable enough so that one can place them wherever they
want, for example, in a project directory for building dependencies. 

This directory is usually located at "~/local/src" and the software packages
are built inside each sub-directory under it. We find this to be most convenient.

<2014-10-03 Fri>
We have introduced some general utility files in the main directory.
The use of these functions has effectively shortened the length of build scripts.

# !+TODO: Add support for progressive modification of the build scripts
#         with respect to different versions of the package
